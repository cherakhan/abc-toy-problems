# abc-toy-problems
A series of 4 toy problems to demonstrate the utility and function of likelihood-free Bayesian inference, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). These problems were created as part of my Master of Research (MRes) thesis on 'Approximate Bayesian Tomography', applying the ideas of likelihood free inference to geophysics.
